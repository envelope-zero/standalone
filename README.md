## Usage

### Quick start

Download the latest release and start the executable.

Then, open [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200) in your browser.

Envelope Zero will create a directory `data` with a file `gorm.db`. This is the database of everything you enter into Envelope Zero, keep it safe!
If you want to move the executable to another directory, you must also move the `data` directory with it, it always has to be in the same directory.
