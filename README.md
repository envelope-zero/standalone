# Envelope Zero - Standalone version

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/envelope-zero/standalone.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/envelope-zero/standalone/releases/latest)

Envelope Zero is a zero-based envelope budgeting app. It's free, open-source and runs on all major operating systems.
All your data is stored locally; nothing is exposed to the outside world. Your data is yours.

You can find a pre-built version for your OS on [the release page](https://github.com/envelope-zero/standalone/releases)

## Quick Start

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/envelope-zero/standalone/releases/latest), decompress it, and start the executable.

Check back every now and then to see if there is a new version - to upgrade, you can simply delete the old executable and start the new one.

## Backing Up Your Data

Envelope Zero stores its data file in the application data directory for your operating system:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%/envelope-zero`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/envelope-zero`
- Other Unix based systems: `~/.local/share/envelope-zero`

By adding this directory to your backup routine, your Envelope Zero data will be safe.
